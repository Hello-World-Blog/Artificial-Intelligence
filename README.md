### Artificial Intelligence can be defined as a trail to mimic Human Intelligence by using the principles of human brain along with the math and statistical knowlege we have.  
To acheive AI, we have developed some learning techniques which we call Machine Learning.  
Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning, which deals with complex data.  
  
This repository contains implementation of several Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms in Python
